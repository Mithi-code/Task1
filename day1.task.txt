Q-Difference between http1.1 vs 2:-

1.From a technical point of view, one of the most significant features that distinguishes HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 is the binary
 framing layer, which can be thought of as a part of the application layer in the internet protocol stack.
2.HTTP/1.1 transfers in plain-text messages, HTTP/2 encodes these into binary, allowing for significantly different 
delivery model possibilities.
3.In HTTP/1.1, flow control relies on the underlying TCP connection. When this connection initiates, both client and
 server establish their buffer sizes using their system default settings.If the receiverâ€™s buffer is partially filled with data,
 it will tell the sender its receive window, i.e., the amount of available space that remains in its buffer.HTTP/2 multiplexes
 streams of data within a single TCP connection. As a result, receive windows on the level of the TCP connection are not 
sufficient to regulate the delivery of individual streams. HTTP/2 solves this problem by allowing the client and server to 
implement their own flow controls, rather than relying on the transport layer.
